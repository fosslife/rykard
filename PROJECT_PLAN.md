# Docker Desktop Alternative - Project Plan

## Overview

This project aims to create a lightweight Docker Desktop alternative using Tauri (Rust + React). The application will provide a modern, clean UI for managing Docker containers and images with essential functionality.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri and Bollard (Docker API client for Rust)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Animations**: motion/react (framer-motion)
- **Icons**: lucide-react
- **State Management**:
  - **Backend**: Tauri state management with Mutex
  - **Frontend**: React Context API / Zustand (future)
